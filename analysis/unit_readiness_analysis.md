# Unit Readiness Analysis

## Objective
Evaluate personnel, equipment, and training readiness across multiple units to identify readiness gaps and support leadership decision-making.

## Data Source
Simulated unit readiness dataset including personnel strength, vehicle availability, and training completion metrics for five units.

## Key Metrics
- Personnel availability rate (personnel available ÷ personnel assigned)
- Vehicle operational rate (vehicles operational ÷ vehicles assigned)
- Training completion percentage

## Findings
- **Echo** and **Alpha** units show the highest overall readiness across all metrics.
- **Delta** unit demonstrates the lowest readiness, driven primarily by reduced vehicle availability.
- Higher training completion percentages appear associated with improved personnel and equipment readiness.

## Assessment
Training completion appears to be a strong indicator of overall unit readiness. Equipment availability, particularly vehicle operational status, is the primary constraint impacting lower-performing units.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize vehicle maintenance resources for units with low operational rates.
- Increase training focus for units below 85% completion.
- Monitor readiness metrics regularly to identify early warning trends.
