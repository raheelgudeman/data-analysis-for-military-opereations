# Readiness Overview Visualizations

## Purpose
This section provides a high-level visual summary of unit readiness metrics to support quick understanding and leadership decision-making.

## Key Metrics Visualized
- Personnel availability by unit
- Vehicle operational readiness by unit
- Training completion rates across units

## Personnel Availability (Conceptual)
A bar chart comparing personnel available versus personnel assigned for each unit highlights relative manpower readiness. Echo and Alpha units demonstrate the strongest personnel availability, while Delta shows the greatest shortfall.

## Vehicle Operational Readiness (Conceptual)
A bar chart of operational versus assigned vehicles reveals that vehicle availability is the primary limiting factor for readiness in lower-performing units, particularly Delta and Bravo.

## Training Completion Rates (Conceptual)
A comparison of training completion percentages shows a clear relationship between higher training completion and overall unit readiness. Units with completion rates above 90% consistently perform better across other metrics.

## Analytical Insight
Visual comparison across units reinforces written analysis findings: training and equipment readiness are the strongest predictors of overall unit readiness and should remain priority focus areas for leadership.
